v0.0.1 - First Version. Decomposes character into two components.
v0.0.2 - Now checks if character is a radical first, if not, then decomposes it into two radicals.
v0.0.3 - If it detects a number it now recursively decomposes until no number is reached. Experimental at this stage.
v0.0.4/v0.1.0 - Changed the versioning to allow for hotfixes. Added a lot new functions, including better decomposition system allowing three levels deep decomposition.
v0.2.0 - Added dictionarySearch, decomposeMany and getExampleWords functions. Most of the code was also refactored by djuretic. Thanks!
v0.2.1 - Changed Leiden University's Sina Weibo Word Frequency corpus data to be a lot simpler and less bulky. Saves a lot more on data transfer. File now a lot smaller.
v0.2.2 - Updated dictionary to return an object rather than an array (djuretic). Also updated getExamples function to return objects to display both traditional and simplified characters. Also a determineIfSimplified function.
v0.2.3 - Changed the radical list into a js array. Also added messy input handling for decomposition.
v0.2.4 - Decompositions are now in a flat array and not embedded. Furthermore, character decomposition is now read as an object. Also fixed some characters with data.
v0.2.5 - Added a function to check if component exists.
v0.2.6 - Added a getRadicalMeaning function and adapted the radicalList file to an object to add the extra info.
v0.2.7 - Added better handling of numbers in the data. Level 1 & 2 replaces the numbers with a string and in level 3 it resolves all numbers.
v0.3.0 - Added determinePhoneticRegularity function
v0.3.1 - Bug fix to determinePhoneticRegularity function
v0.3.2 - Added phonetic set data generated from using the determinePhoneticRegularity function. Also added getPhoneticSet function.
